            Hello everyone, my name is Eric Carlson and I am 22 years old.  I lived in California my whole life and love my state, no where else I want to be.  When I'm not immersed in my coding work I love to go hiking or golfing.  When I have free time I also love to play video games and go to bars with friends.

        </p>

        <p>
        I took this course because I wanted to learn about coding and get out of a dead end job.  I'm looking to keep getting back up no matter how many times I get knocked down.  I've learned that the things you put the most effort into is the best feeling.  My goal is to better myself in code and apply those skills into the workforce.  The first steps are always the most challenging but once you pass that first hurdle the rest follow in stride.  Don't stop coding!
        </p>
